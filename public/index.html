            <h1>Help</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            Zupiter is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer" target=”_blank”>modular synthesizer</a> that runs
            in your web browser, loosely inspired by Pure Data, Max/MSP, and other visual programming languages. Essentially,
            it's a tool that allows you to build your own synthesizer by creating new nodes (modules) and connecting
            them together. By connecting nodes with edges, you control how audio data and control signals flow from one
            node to another and how sound is generated.
            </p>

            <p>
            For those who are new to synthesizers and sound synthesis,
            <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-beginners-guide-to-the-synth-1736978695" target=”_blank”>A Beginner's Guide to the Synth</a>
            is a good introduction to the basic concepts involved.
            Please don't hesitate to ask any question,
            offer feedback and report bugs in the
            <a href="https://reddit.com/r/musictools" target=”_blank”>musictools subreddit</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Basics</h2>

            <h3>Node Types</h3>
            Each node has input ports on the left, output ports on the right, and performs some operation
            internally. Nodes like Add and Mul will add and multiply two input signals together. Sine, Saw, Pulse
            and Noise are oscillators (signal sources). The AudioOut node takes a left and right signal and plays
            it back on your speakers.

            <h3>Creating New Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            Clicking on empty space in the Edit tab will make a dialog menu pop up which allows you to select the
            kind of node you want to create. Once the node is created, you can drag it around by clicking on the
            node's name and holding the left mouse button as you move the mouse.
            </p>

            <h3>Connecting Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            Nodes can have input and output ports, represented by orange boxes. By convention, the input ports of
            a node are always on the left side, and the output ports are on the right. You can only connect output
            ports to input ports. One output can be connected to multiple inputs, but each in put can only be
            connected to one output. To make a connection, simply click on the first port to connect, and then
            on the second. A white line (edge) representing the connection will appear.
            </p>

            <h3>Moving Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            To move a node, click on the node's name and hold down the mouse button while moving the mouse.
            </p>

            <h3>Deleting Nodes</h3>
            <p>
            You can delete nodes by holding down the shift key while clicking on a node's name.
            </p>

            <h3>Removing Connections</h3>
            <p>
            To break connections, you can click on the input-side port
            associated with that connection. This will break the connection, and leave you holding a dangling
            wire which you can then reconnect to an input port on another node. You can also drop the
            dangling connection by clicking on an empty part of the canvas.
            <p>

            <p>
            It's also possible to override existing connections. In Zupiter, output-side ports can be
            connected to multiple inputs, but input-side ports can can only be connected to one thing.
            When you try to connect an output port to an input port that already is connected to something,
            this will remove the previous connection on that input port and override it with the new
            connection you just made.
            </p>

            <h3>Editing Node Parameters</h3>
            <p>
            Double-clicking on a node's name will make a Node Parameters menu specific to this node pop up.
            This allows you to edit advanced parameters, such as the minimum and maximum value a knob can output,
            or the output range of a sine oscillator.
            </p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>

            This section contains some simple example synth graphs which can serve as mini tutorials to
            help you get started.

            <h3>Producing Sound</h3>
            <p>
            In order to produce a sound, we need to connect an audio signal source to an audio output. The
            <a href="#28" target="_blank">simplest possible graph</a>
            that you could make to do this involves connecting a Noise node directly to an AudioOut
            node. Try creating this simple graph, and then press the Play button in the top-right corner.
            </p>

            <h3>Playing Some Notes</h3>
            <p>
            The MidiIn node allows you to get pitch and gate inputs for notes played on a computer keyboard
            or MIDI input device. The pitch value is the frequency of the note played. The gate value is one
            when a key is held down, or zero otherwise.
            </p>

            <p>
            This <a href="#31" target="_blank">example graph</a> uses the pitch value to directly control
            a sawtooth wave oscillator. The gate value is then multiplied by the oscillator's output, so
            that you only hear a sound when a note is playing.
            </p>

            <p>Press the play button in the top-right corner, and then try pressing the A to L keys on
            your keyboard to produce sound. You can also shift one octave up or down with the Z and X keys.
            If you want to use a MIDI input device, you should connect this device to your computer
            before loading up Zupiter (or refresh the page).
            </p>

            <h3>Volume Knob</h3>
            <p>
            It's useful to be able to change the amplitude (intensity) of a signal. An easy way to do this
            is to multiply that signal by some number. In <a href="#32" target="_blank">this example</a>,
            we multiply the output of a noise source by some factor that is controlled by a knob. You can
            change the value that the knob produces by clicking on the knob, holding the mouse button
            down and moving your mouse up and down. Knobs, by default, produce values between 0 and 1.
            However, you can change the output range of a knob by double clicking on its name (where it
            says "Knob") and editing the node's parameters.
            </p>

            <h2>MIDI Support</h2>
            <p>
            Zupiter can receive input from MIDI keyboards, sequencers and other types of MIDI devices. The
            MidiIn note, by default, will connect to every MIDI device on your system and receive notes. You
            can also map virtual knobs in Zupiter to physical knobs on a MIDI device by double-clicking on
            the virtual knob and then wiggling the physical knob you want to map to. If input from
            your device is not detected, try refreshing the Zupiter page.
            </p>

            <p>
            Most MIDI controllers should work with Zupiter out of the box, but if you are looking to purchase
            new equipment, I have personally tested the Novation Launch Control, which has multiple mappable knobs,
            the M-Audio KeyStation 88, and the Akai MPK Mini.
            </p>

            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>
            Please don't hesitate to ask any question, offer feedback and report bugs in the
            <a href="https://reddit.com/r/musictools" target=”_blank”>musictools subreddit</a>.
            However, please note that at the moment, I do not own a tablet. I only have access to Mac and Linux PCs.
            As such, Zupiter is only tested on Chrome and Firefox on those two platforms. Support for tablets,
            Windows computers and other platforms is not guaranteed.

            <h2>Creating Zupiter</h2>
            I wanted to build a music creation tool that is easy to use, accessible and free. Zupiter is a synthesizer and
            step-sequencer that runs in a browser,
            meaning you don't even need to download and install any software to use it. Its interface is designed to be
            minimalistic and simple, so as not to put off beginners. The sharing feature gives you the ability to instantly
            put your work online. My hope is that this will enable the sharing of creative ideas and encourage cooperation between
            people, producing a positive feedback loop.
