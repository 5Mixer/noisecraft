The sample & hold node is now able to handle loops, which makes it possible to use it as a counter.\n\nHere, the hold node is triggered every time a MIDI note is received (try pressing A on your keyboard, after pressing Play in the top-right corner). The counter then counts from 0 to 3 (integers modulo 4)."}}}}
